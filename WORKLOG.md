1) Worked on Stage 2 of the algorithm. It broke after I added 16 bits to the shift registers.

2) Can't get Stage 2 to agree with better implementation of A5/1

2) Throw together an implementation of A5/1. It doesn't follow the C version or the interactive version. The beginning of my implementation follows the interactive version up to the point where we load the 64th bit of key into the registers. From that point on, I use the basic structure of the c version. The loading of initialization vector and the key are different though. I can't figure out how to edit my loops to closer follow the c version, as fundamentally the algorithm should be the same, even though I currently have no way to test it as the loading between their version and mine is different.
